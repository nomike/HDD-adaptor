This project contains an OpenSCAD model of a 2.5" to 3.5" HDD adaptor.

The adaptor is designed to fit a 2.5" HDD into a 3.5" HDD slot. Sliders could be generated which will fit into a HP ProDesk 600 G1 computer case. Multiple adaptors could be stacked and screwed together to fit multiple 2.5" HDDs into a single 3.5" HDD slot.

The model is parametric and can be adjusted to fit other cases.

#### Usage

Just run `make` to generate files for all common HDD thicknesses and with all supported slider types.

#### Mounting

You should use M3 screws to mount the HDD to the adaptor. The screws should be 5mm long.

To connect two adaptors together you should use M2.5 cylinder-head screws and nuts. The length of those screws depends on the adapter height. The screwheads of the HDD mounting screw will pertrude from the underside of the adaptors. This has been accomodated by the design to allow enough space for stacking.

The top-most adapter could use the lowest profile version to save on filament and print time.

**Note:** Even though I read somewhere that PLA is not suitable for HDD adaptors due to disks getting hot and PLA not being able to withstand the heat, I have been using PLA so far and haven't noticed any issues. I'm running a NAS where the disks are around 30°C in a room with ~20°C. And even on hot summer days the disks won't get near to any temperature where PLA would start to soften. PLA will begin to deform or warp at 60-65°C. Most HDDs are rated for 50°C, some for up to 60°C. So PLA should be fine for most use cases.
